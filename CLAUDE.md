# JChat Claude Compatibility Notes

Canonical project documentation moved to:
- `/Users/josh/Projects/JChat/Docs/PROJECT_GUIDE.md`

UI source of truth:
- [Apple SwiftUI Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui)
- Follow current Apple HIG behavior, prefer Liquid Glass/material surfaces, and use SF Symbols.

Workflow standards moved to:
- `/Users/josh/Projects/JChat/CONTRIBUTING.md`

Xcode task policy:
- Use `xcodebuildmcp` for all Xcode tasks in this repo; do not use raw `xcodebuild`.

Multi-agent usage policy (Codex vs Plan mode vs OpenSpec) is defined in:
- `/Users/josh/Projects/JChat/CONTRIBUTING.md`

Always use Context7 MCP when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.
