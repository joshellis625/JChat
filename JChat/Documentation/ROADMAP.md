# JChat Roadmap

## Active Priorities
1. Workflow foundation and CI safety net
2. Documentation cohesion and reduced duplication
3. UI/UX pass on highest-friction screens
4. Reliability guardrails via targeted tests
5. Solo-dev playbooks and repeatable process

## Near-Term Backlog
- First-launch onboarding for API key + default model
- Cmd+N shortcut for new chat
- Improved long-input behavior in message composer
- Better code-block contrast in markdown rendering

## Future Exploration
- Memory feature across chats
- Tool/function calling controls
- SillyTavern character import
- Provider routing controls
